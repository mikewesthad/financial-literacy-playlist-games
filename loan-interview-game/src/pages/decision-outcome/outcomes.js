      While Taylor is your boss’s cousin, they turned out to be unreliable. Without a clear plan to
      pay back the loan and without any history of paying bills on time, they just blew through the
      money and have nothing to show for it. They never paid back the loan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next time, try looking for someone with a clear plan to repay the loan and who has a history
      of making payments on time.

      While Hannah is a good friend of your boss, they turned out to be unreliable. They have a
      history of making payments on time and a plan to repay the loan, but they also have maxed out
      credit cards and a history of losing their job. They used the loan to buy a car, but ended up
      quitting their new job. Since they were already struggling with credit card debit, they still
      haven’t paid back the loan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next time, try looking for someone who doesn’t have a lot of existing debt and who has a
      stable job.

const anthonyOutcome = (
  <div>
    <p>
      Anthony was a perfect choice! They had a repayment plan, a stable job and a history of paying
      off loans. They were able to take the night classes, get the new job in marketing at the
      library and pay your boss back all within a year.
